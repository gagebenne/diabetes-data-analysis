## **Co**ntext

We will explore a dataset courtesy of Dr. John Schorling at the Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine. This dataset consists of was conducted to understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors amongst African Americans in central Virginia.

## **N**eed

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national-diabetes-statistics-report.pdf), around 2.8% of individuals living in the United States that have undiagnosed diabetes. Early discovery and diagnosis are key to preventing and managing diabetes. Predicting a diabetes diagnosis by predicted A1c based on a subset of 19 variables included in the dataset would be beneficial for a few reasons: many of the variables described are either instant or rapid metrics that can be taken at home or during a normal physical exam. Without having to perform an invasive lab draw to determine hemoglobin A1c (`glyhb`), predicting a diabetes diagnosis by modeling the A1c results determines whether further actions should be taken as well as shows some possible predictive variables.

## **V**ision

The goal is to use domain knowledge to improve performance of a model predicting A1c values based on various measurements of the body's most basic functions and aspects. We'd like to produce a model that explains A1c values indicative of diabetes, preferrably more accurately than a comparable null model.

## **O**utcome

Our predictive model will produce a model that is useful for individuals to predict hemoglobin A1c values using ordinary routine physical exam metrics such as BMI, cholesterol, and so on. This information will be delivered to stakeholders via organized jupyter notebooks, along with a report summarizing any conclusions from the data retrieval, exploration, as well as modeling. A brief explainatory video will also be produced, walking through the various stages of the process.
